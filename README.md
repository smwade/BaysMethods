# Bayesian Methods and Probabilistic Programming  

*CS 697R: Sean Wade*

###  Overview

This class is ment to be an applied first approach to modeling and machine learning with Bayesian methods and probabilistic programming. The course will primaraly follow the books and assignments layed out in *Probabilistic Programming & Bayesian Methods for Hackers* with supplemental reading and meterial outlined in the materials section. 

Topics that will be mastered through readings and projects include: Bayesian analysis of statistical models, computing methods like MCMC, graphical models, nonparametric Bayesian models, EM Algorithm, Variational Inference, construction of probabilistic models, and Baysian deep learning.

To maintain progress and accountability throughout the course, Dr. Wingate and I will consistently be communicating. At the start of the class both of us will have the schedule with assignmets and reading week by week. Then Friday of every week I will email a summary of my reading along with the homework assignment for the week. Asides from this primary from of communication we will also talk every 2-3 week to answer any questions I have with the material.

My grade for the course will be determined by my reading summarys and weekly projects. There will be 10 projects with 7 taken from the text book and 3 that I Dr. Wingate and I create. There will be a little portion of the projects dedicated to mathematical proofs but the bulk of the assignments will be applied problem solving and code. The other part of my grade will be writing 4 papers in the form of in depth blog posts. These will document my learning process and summerize my readings.

### Outcomes

Apply, implement, and interpret a fully Bayesian approach to statistical problems. Including design, model selection, and model fitting. Gain a deep understanding of how this extends and relates to traditional machine learning and mathematical modeling.
